Week 10 Homework for UT Austin Full Stack Web Development Course
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

The LIRI-bot takes 4 commands:

my-tweets 
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says

First command will fetch my last 20 tweets.
Second command takes a song title as an argument and returns relevant info.
Third command does the same thing as the song, but with a movie title
Fourth command will do any of the above 3, but will read command input out of a text file named random.txt
